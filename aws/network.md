**Multi-tier:**
Multi-tier architecture divides software components into layers like presentation, application/logic, and data tiers, offering protection against threats and enhancing solution availability. In Amazon VPC, it adds extra defense layers to safeguard sensitive resources.

**Multi-VPC:**
Multi-VPC architecture creates separate virtual networks in AWS Cloud, allowing secure communication between application parts. Multiple VPCs offer flexibility, security, and robust analytics. For instance, a sales app might interact with a shared customer database across different VPCs.

**High Availability:**
High availability prevents interruptions in network communication, achieved through redundancy and load sharing. It ensures smooth operation, reduces downtime, and controls costs. In AWS, redundancy is ensured through Availability Zones, and applications are considered highly available if they can tolerate zone failures.

**Hybrid Network:**
A hybrid network links on-premises and cloud networks, offering scalability and agility. It enables resource scaling based on demand, cost savings, and compliance with regulations. Hybrid setups can involve combinations of AWS and on-premises networks or third-party services.

**High Performance:**
High performance ensures quick and efficient data transfer across a network, minimizing delays and disruptions. Latency reduction, achieved through factors like route quality and node proximity, is crucial. It improves user experience, requires setting performance goals, and simulating network traffic for optimization.
